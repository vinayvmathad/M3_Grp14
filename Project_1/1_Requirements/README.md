# Introduction
  * RKE system consists of an RF transmitter in the keyfob (or key) that sends a short burst of digital data to a receiver in the vehicle, where it is decoded and made to open or close the vehicle doors or the trunk via receiver-controlled actuators. The wireless carrier frequency, is currently 315MHz in the US/Japan and 433.92MHz (ISM band) in Europe. In Japan the modulation is frequency-shift keying (FSK), but in most other parts of the world, amplitude-shift keying, or ASK is used. The carrier is amplitude modulated between two levels: To save power, the lower level is usually near zero, producing complete on-off keying (OOK).
  ## High Level Requirements:
   | ID |   High Level REquirements   |
   |----|-----------------------------|
   |HR01|   	  Print lock             |
   |HR02|   	   Print Unlock          |
   |HR03|Alarm Activation/Deactivation|  
   |HR04|   	Print approach light     | 
   ### Low Level Requirements:
  | ID |      Low level Requirements      | HR ID|
  |----|----------------------------------|------|
  |LR01|All led on at the same time       | HR01 |
  |LR02|All led off at the same time      | HR02 |
  |LR03|All led on in clockwise manner    | HR03 |
  |LR04|All led on in Anticlockwise manner| HR04 |
  * Features
  * Used to Unlock and lock the car door without any key.
* Swot Analysis:
  * Strengths:
    * Convenience. Not having to fumble with a key in a handbag or pocket or a keypad on a door (remember those?) is a major selling point of this technology.
    * Security. Since you can gain entry so much quicker, you spend less time out in the open where someone might try to rob or hijack you.
    * Remote starting. With remote start offered on the best of these systems, you can lock or unlock the door while it's parked in your driveway.
  * Weakness:
    * Leaving the engine running. People have exited their vehicles without realizing the engine is still running, which is especially dangerous in enclosed spaces.
    * Forgetting to select park. People might miss that the engine is still running and get out of the car to open a gate, not realising the vehicle is not in park. The car can roll away and cause damage, injury, or death.
    * Could be hacked. Security is improving, but some systems have been susceptible to hacking and cars have been stolen this way.
  * Opurtunities:
    * Deals increment of worldwide auto deals industry has activated car keyless passage frameworks advertise.
    * Financial scenery around the globe and positive deals position raised interest of the part.
  * Threats:
    * Could be hacked
    * Failure of Machine/Remote.
    * Applications
  * Remote keyless entry systems, now fairly commonplace devices, provide car owners with a degree of convenience, making the task of physically inserting a key unnecessary.
  * A passive keyless entry (PKE) system uses advanced technology to take vehicle accessibility to a higher level. 
  * Bi-directional communication makes this possible. When the door handle is pulled (or some similar trigger is activated) the base unit located within the vehicle emits a short range, low frequency signal – polling for a nearby key fob transponder.
  * If present, the key fob recognizes the signal and responds with a UHF (ultra-high frequency) signal, transmitting a code to be authenticated by the base unit encryption firmware, such as Microchip Technology’s Keylock.
  * Finally, if a proper code is verified, the base unit instructs the vehicle’s central body controller to unlock the door. Of course, all of this takes place within a fraction of a second, without any additional action from the user.
  * 5W'S and 1H:
  * WHAT:
    * It is used to lock and unlock the door without key.
  * When:
    * It is used in Cars to lock or unlock.
  * Who :
    * It is useful for everyone for example people use for locking and unlocking the car door.
  * Where:
    * It is used mainly in cars.
  * Why:
    * It is used to lock and unlock the door without key.
  * How:
    * It is useful for lock and unlock the door by pressing the button on remote.
